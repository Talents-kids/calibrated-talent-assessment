abstract: |
  Early identification of children's talents remains a critical challenge in
  personalized education. We present a multimodal AI system analyzing authentic
  creative artifacts from 5,237 analyses across 479 children to predict talent
  profiles across 7 domains. Classical machine learning models (LightGBM)
  achieved ROC-AUC 0.9999 and F1-macro 0.9972 with Expected Calibration Error
  0.0018. Our multi-agent LLM system employed 34 models from 9 providers
  achieving near-perfect correlation (r>0.98) with meta-model aggregated ground
  truth at $0.041 per analysis. Temporal validation demonstrated F1-macro 0.833
  at 5.7 months and 0.742 at 11.4 months. SHAP analysis revealed interpretable
  features aligned with educational psychology theory.
